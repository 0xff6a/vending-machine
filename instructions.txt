Programming Exercise
Design a vending machine in code. The vending machine, 
- once a product is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, should return that product. 
- It should also return change if too much money is provided or ask for more money if there is not enough. 
- The machine should take an initial load of products and change with denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2. 
- There should also be a way of reloading both products and change at a later point. 
- The machine needs to keep track of the products and money that it contains.
